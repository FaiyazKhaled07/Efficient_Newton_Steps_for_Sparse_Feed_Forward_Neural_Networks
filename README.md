# Efficient_Newton_Steps_for_Sparse_Feed_Forward_Neural_Networks
For solving a system of n-non linear equations Newton-Raphson method is utilized in conjunction with sparse feed-forward neural
networks. A factorized Newton method have been developed to perform Newton step to reduce the computational cost and make it
efficient for large amount of data.
